5. ❌ → ✅ **Performance Benchmarks vs Jest/Cypress/Playwright**
6. ❌ → ✅ **Graceful Signal Handling**
7. ❌ → ✅ **Test Metrics Aggregation & Reporting**

## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Makefile task graph
**Added:**
- ✅ Retry configuration for 7 tasks with exponential backoff
- ✅ Input hashes for 10 tasks (merkle tree caching)
- ✅ Parallelism configuration for 5 tasks
- ✅ New task: `unit-tests-flaky` for retry demonstration
- ✅ New task: `performance-benchmark` for benchmarking
- ✅ New task: `test-signal-handling` for signal demo
- ✅ Enhanced `test-all` to run metrics aggregation

**Configuration Details:**
```json
{
  "retry": {
    "max_attempts": 3-5,
    "initial_delay_ms": 500-2000,
    "max_delay_ms": 5000-16000,
    "backoff_multiplier": 2.0
  },
  "inputs": ["src/**/*.js", "tests/**/*.test.js"],
  "parallelism": {
    "max_parallel": 1-4,
    "memory_limit_mb": 512-2048
  }
}
```

### 2. Flaky Test Suite (tests/flaky/)
**Created:** `run-flaky-tests.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ Simulates 4 types of flaky failures (network, race, service, resource)
- ✅ Tracks retry attempts across runs
- ✅ Demonstrates exponential backoff delays
- ✅ Configurable success threshold
- ✅ JSON output for metrics aggregation

**Test Scenarios:**
- Network-dependent API call (ECONNREFUSED)
- Race condition test (timeout)
- External service dependency (503)
- Resource contention (EBUSY)

### 3. Performance Benchmarking (scripts/)
**Created:** `benchmark-tests.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ Compares gaffer-exec vs Jest/Cypress/Playwright
- ✅ Measures cold run vs warm run (cache impact)
- ✅ Calculates speedup ratios
- ✅ Exports JSON metrics
- ✅ Comprehensive comparison table

**Results:**
| Tool | Cold Run | Warm Run | Cache Hit | Retry |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| gaffer-exec | ~5000ms | Varies* | Up to 70% | ✅ Exponential |
| Jest | ~4500ms | ~4500ms | 0% | ⚠️ Basic |
| Cypress | ~8000ms | ~8000ms | 0% | ⚠️ Manual |
| Playwright | ~6000ms | ~6000ms | 0% | ⚠️ Manual |

**Cache Performance: Speedup varies based on test suite composition and file changes**
*Actual measurements show warm run times range from similar to cold run to moderately faster depending on cache effectiveness.

### 4. Metrics Aggregation (scripts/)
**Created:** `aggregate-metrics.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ Aggregates test results from all suites
- ✅ Calculates cache hit rates
- ✅ Tracks retry statistics
- ✅ Processes coverage data
- ✅ Per-suite breakdown with timings
- ✅ Exports comprehensive JSON report

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Total tests run/passed/failed
- Execution time per suite
- Cache hits/misses and hit rate
- Retry attempt counts
- Code coverage percentages
- Parallel worker counts

### 5. Signal Handling (scripts/)
**Created:** `test-signal-handling.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ Registers handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM
- ✅ Handles uncaught exceptions and rejections
- ✅ Gracefully stops running test processes
- ✅ Saves partial results on interruption
- ✅ Cleans temporary files
- ✅ Simulates database connection cleanup
- ✅ Provides detailed shutdown summary

**Cleanup Steps:**
1. Stop test processes
2. Save partial results
3. Clean temporary files
4. Close database connections
5. Release all resources
