# gaffer-exec Examples

This repository contains usage examples for **gaffer-exec**, a build orchestration tool.

## About These Examples

These examples were generated using Large Language Model (LLM) assistance as part of exploring automated software development workflows.

**About gaffer-exec:**
- gaffer-exec is a real build orchestration tool (private source)
- Official releases are attested by GitHub and available in this public repository
- The tool itself is production-quality software, not LLM-generated
- Only the usage examples in this repository were created with LLM assistance

**What this means for the examples:**
- Code patterns and structures follow common open-source conventions but were synthesized rather than manually written
- Examples demonstrate gaffer-exec capabilities but may contain implementation gaps or simulated features
- While designed to be functional, some components use mock services or simplified logic for demonstration purposes
- Documentation may describe ideal behavior that isn't fully implemented in all cases

**Limitations to be aware of:**
- LLMs can produce code that compiles but may have subtle logic errors
- Performance claims and benchmarks may be based on projections rather than actual measurements
- Edge cases and error handling may be incomplete
- Integration with real-world systems may require additional validation and testing

**Use responsibly:**
- Treat these as starting points and learning resources, not production-ready code
- Test thoroughly before adapting for your own use
- Verify claims against your specific requirements
- Check for security implications in your environment

This project embraces transparency about AI-generated content and encourages critical evaluation of these examples.
